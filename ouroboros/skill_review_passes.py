over-budget skill is split into multiple budget-sized packs — a chunked pass per pack
whose per-model finding arrays are merged into one, so every byte is reviewed without
silent truncation and the existing quorum/aggregation produces one verdict.

Lives outside ``skill_review`` (module-size discipline). The prompt builder and the
multi-model review callable are INJECTED so this module never imports ``skill_review``
(no circular dependency). Every configured delivery row receives the SAME hardened,
