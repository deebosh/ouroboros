"""Ouroboros-owned Claudexor daemon (D30).

Ouroboros runs its OWN ``claudexord`` under a data-plane config dir
(``CLAUDEXOR_CONFIG_DIR`` — the override IS the complete relocatable root:
config, credential profiles, secrets, daemon token, socket, runs). The
operator's personal ``~/.claudexor`` state is never read, never imported and
never touched: coexisting daemons per config dir are the engine's own
first-class seam, and the owner's existing logins stay the owner's (accounts
for the Ouroboros home are logged in fresh, through the daemon's own login
jobs).

Lifecycle follows the local-model-server template:

* spawn through ``process_custody`` (session scope) so a dead server
  generation's daemon is reaped by fingerprint, never by command-line class;
* ATTACH-IF-ALIVE: a live daemon already serving our config dir (a previous
  generation's, custody-pending) is attached to, not duplicated — the engine
  refuses a second daemon on the same socket anyway;
* OWN-ONLY-IF-SELF-STARTED: ``stop`` terminates only a process THIS manager
  spawned. An attached daemon — ours-by-home or anyone else's — is never
  killed here; foreign daemons are not ours to stop, and the custody reaper
  already owns cross-generation cleanup for self-spawned ones.

Zero auth logic lives here or anywhere in Ouroboros: login jobs, device-code
custody, verification and rotation are the daemon's own product surface,
reached through the ``/v2`` control API (``gateways/claudexor.py``).

        The predecessor was a spawn-only best-effort patch: one attempt at
        provisioning, a bare except, and no read-back — so a race with the
        daemon's startup "serving recovery only" window failed it forever,
        attach paths never patched at all, and a harness discovered later was
        never covered. This runs on EVERY ``ensure_owned_gateway`` instead
        (owner decision 5=A, literal: no read-path TTL — each ensure does the
        GET, computes the missing set and POSTs conditionally), against the
        gateway that ensure just handshook:

        * GET the effective settings snapshot, then POST only when a
          discovered harness carries NO ``profileLimitAction`` at all — an
          explicitly persisted ``fail``/``ask``/``rotate`` is the owner's (or
          the engine's) word and is never overwritten (owner decision 3=A);
        * skip engines whose version owns kind-aware "auto" defaults (A6+):
          their judgment is strictly better than a blanket "rotate";
        * the non-blocking lock exists purely to dedup CONCURRENT ensures —
          the overlapping caller is covered by the reconcile in flight;
        * ANY failure — the daemon's typed startup "recovery only" refusal
          included — simply retries on the next ensure; no special case;
        * a POST that actually changed policy leaves a durable receipt under
          ``state/`` naming the daemon and the patched harnesses;
        * never patches a home ``verify_owned_home`` rejects (never-adopt).

        Best-effort by contract: raises nothing, so a reconcile hiccup can
        never eat the delegation or login that ensured the daemon.

    This is the explicit start/probe seam — the ONE funnel every consumer
    (delegation, review sessions, account surfaces, login) passes through,
    which is why the rotation reconcile rides it: spawn AND attach paths are
    both covered, on every ensure, best-effort (see ``reconcile_rotation``).
    The gateway transport itself stays pure I/O; callers own ``close()`` (or
    use it as a context manager). Daemon stop semantics are unchanged: only
    ``get_owned_daemon().stop()`` may stop a process this manager spawned,
    and it never kills an attached process.

    ADMISSION is waited for here — outside the daemon manager's lock, the same
    way for a fresh spawn and an attach. A daemon whose handshake explicitly
    says ``servingMode=recovery_only`` answers every product route 503
    (``daemon_recovery_only``, retryable), so the handshake is re-polled about
    every 150 ms under a wall-clock deadline of ``admission_wait_sec`` seconds
    (default ``_ADMISSION_WAIT_SEC``, resolved at call time so tests can shrink
    it), each poll's read phase bounded by what is left of the window. Expiry
    raises the SAME typed refusal the 503 produces — the dispatch table already
    classifies it (auto → native with a loud marker, pin → blocked) — and the
    recovering daemon is left alive (D28: bounded wait, then typed refusal;
    never a silent indefinite wait, never a kill). ``admission_wait_sec=0`` is
    the zero-wait variant for callers that must not stall on ADMISSION: a
    recovering daemon is an immediate typed refusal there, and the initial
    handshake below is read-bounded by the same small window. The wait bounds
    admission only — ``ensure_running``'s own liveness/spawn probes keep their
    pre-existing finite transport ceilings (connect 5s; they are one identity
    handshake, not a poll loop), unchanged for every caller of this seam.
    An expired/failed admission also skips the reconcile: the recovering
    daemon 503s settings reads anyway, and the next ensure retries it.
