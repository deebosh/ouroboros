"""The ONE decision about which governance documents a reviewer receives in full.

Owner decision (2026-09-17, batch 2 question 1 = A): every review surface —
triad, scope, advisory, deep self-review — asks this module which rules it must
carry inline and which it reaches through a navigation map. Three tiers:

1. **Rules, always inline.** The surface's applicable ``docs/CHECKLISTS.md``
   section (supplied by the caller, which owns its own section name), the
   shared section every reviewer of this repository's code applies
   (:data:`SHARED_CHECKLIST_SECTION`, loaded here), ``BIBLE.md`` whole and
   ``docs/CHECKLISTS_ARCHIVE.md`` whole. This tier is byte-stable across
   commits, so the caller puts it in its cache-marked prefix.
2. **Rules by change class, within a budget share.** ``docs/DESIGN.md`` when the
   change touches ``web/``; the review-and-commit protocol chapter always; and
   every DEVELOPMENT chapter whose text mentions a touched file NAME. Bounded by
   :data:`~ouroboros.runtime_limits.REVIEW_GOVERNANCE_INLINE_SHARE` of the
   reviewer's usable window, largest-relevance-first.
3. **Map, never whole.** ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` arrives as book navigation for
   every delivery. A PACKET reviewer (a row with no tools of its own)
   additionally receives the top-level sections whose text mentions a touched
   file name, from the same budget; a RETRIEVING row gets the navigation and
   reads what it needs with its own ``read_file``.

Every document that is not inlined is NAMED in the returned manifest and in the
navigation text, never silently dropped (BIBLE P1), and the manifest is the
disclosure record the durable review evidence carries.

Choosing which reference chapter to inline from an exact file-name mention is
context ASSEMBLY, not behaviour selection: no verdict, routing decision or
reviewer judgment depends on the match, and the reviewer may read anything else
it wants. No LLM call; one tree plus one touched-path list gives one result.
