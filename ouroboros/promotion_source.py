    Returns ``(workspace_root, note, error, effective_project_id,
    created_project)``.  Keeping this side effect on the authoritative handler
    side prevents a stale tool snapshot from cloning/registering a project
    after the worker pool was disabled but before the queued event was
    rejected. ``created_project`` is True only when THIS resolution registered
    the project row — the promote continuation carries it so the one
    workers-side ``project_started`` announce still fires for a creation that
    happened in this off-loop half (owner 2=A: it is the same agent-initiated
    promote flow). ``project_name`` is the display name the model gave: this
    half registers the row FIRST, and a later named ``create_project`` returns
    the existing row untouched, so a name withheld here is lost for good and
    the Project shows its id (``proj_<digest>`` for a non-Latin name).
