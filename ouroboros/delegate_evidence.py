"""The read-side execution-evidence projection over the delegate custody rows.

Extracted from ``ouroboros/delegate_custody.py`` at its module-size ceiling: this
is one coherent READ concern — what a task's delegated runs provably did — with a
single completion-seam consumer (``subagents.envelope_from_task``).
``delegate_custody`` re-exports it (same object), so every existing reference and
monkeypatch target keeps the one historical name. Custody primitives are imported
lazily inside the function so this leaf never participates in an import cycle
with the module that owns the rows.
