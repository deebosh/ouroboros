"""Durable custody for delegated (Claudexor) runs.

A delegated run is an OVERPOWERED, MUTATING process that Ouroboros does not own the
process tree of: it lives inside the Claudexor daemon and survives our worker, so
custody cannot live in a module dict — a crash, restart, or lost POST response would
leave a LIVE run nothing can wait on, cancel or settle. ``maxSeconds`` is damage
limitation, not custody.

**The authority is the durable record that is already written.** The task's own event
log (``logs/events.jsonl`` under the canonical data root) is the SSOT; the
process-local dict below is a pure memoization of these rows, and every question is
answered by replaying them. Rows survive a restart, so custody does too.

Three lookup answers, never two: OWNED, FOREIGN (another task started it) and UNKNOWN
(no durable record at all). Collapsing UNKNOWN into "not yours" is what made a restarted
owner indistinguishable from an intruder.
