"""Rolling-24h spend of consciousness: its wake-ups plus the tasks they started.

Owner decision В11/В18 (PLAN 5.5, 5.13 п.11, 5.14 п.1): the daily allowance
gates NEW starts (a wake, a promoted/scheduled root) on the money the whole
consciousness tree accounted in the last 24 hours. There is no root index —
the roots are read off the ledger itself: every FINAL row younger than the
fold horizon (``USAGE_LEDGER_FOLD_MIN_AGE_SEC``, 48 h — younger attempts are
never folded, so their ``ts`` is the true spend time) whose category is
``consciousness`` (a wake's own rows) or ``consciousness_task`` (a started
root's rows) names a consciousness root; the window is then every money row
(attempt / subscription_session / external_unmetered — never a folded
``usage_baseline_group`` or a ``legacy_*`` row) with ``ts`` inside the last
24 h under one of those roots, reduced by the ONE money reducer
``_usage_rows._summary``. ``accounted_usd`` (settled + reserved + unresolved)
is the number: a hanging reservation can read as exhausted for its lifetime,
disclosed rather than hidden; ``unknown_unmetered`` makes it "at least".

The row selection is memoized by ledger fingerprint through the same
``_render_cached`` seam as ``usage_projection``; the TIME filter runs on
every call, so an exhausted window frees itself as rows age out without a
new ledger write. A ledger that cannot be read yields the typed
``allowance_unknown`` outcome — the caller refuses the start honestly.
