"""Reviewer dispatch primitives: the row-identity mint (moved whole from
``review_substrate.py`` at the module-size gate, same split shape as
``skill_review_cycles.py``) and the write-ahead PAID stamp seam (owner
Q16/Q17; Max-Review-Cycles fix round).

The ``paid`` fact of Max-Review-Cycles accounting is recorded at PHYSICAL
dispatch: a gate that must durably record "this wave spent reviewer money"
installs a :class:`ReviewPaidStamp` on ``ctx._review_paid_stamp`` for the
duration of its wave, and the shared reviewer transport entry
(``review_custody.run_custodied_review_slots``) invokes it after slot resolution and
immediately before worker fan-out. The coordinator also captures that exact
once-only object: session routes invoke it before their replayable
``START_REQUESTED`` row, while API routes bind it for the canonical physical-
attempt boundary. Assembly-only refusals (triad fit ladder, scope pack signals,
skill prompt building) exit before the seam, so a $0 attempt stays outside
every ceiling; a worker that outlives its logical caller cannot race the
write-ahead fact, and a crash after dispatch keeps the durable paid fact.
Commit review verifies this write fail-closed; other callers retain historical
fail-open accounting. This seam also hosts the L-review lane's two-phase admission.
