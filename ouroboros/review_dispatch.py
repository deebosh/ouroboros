"""Reviewer dispatch primitives: the row-identity mint (moved whole from
``review_substrate.py`` at the module-size gate, same split shape as
``skill_review_cycles.py``) and the write-ahead PAID stamp seam (owner
Q16/Q17; Max-Review-Cycles fix round).

The ``paid`` fact of Max-Review-Cycles accounting is recorded at PHYSICAL
dispatch: a gate that must durably record "this wave spent reviewer money"
installs a :class:`ReviewPaidStamp` on ``ctx._review_paid_stamp`` for the
duration of its wave, and the shared reviewer transport entry
(``review_substrate.run_review_request``) invokes it immediately before the
first transport call. Assembly-only refusals (triad fit ladder, scope pack
signals, skill prompt building) exit before the seam, so a $0 attempt stays
outside every ceiling; a crash after dispatch keeps the durable paid fact
(write-ahead). This seam is also where the L-review lane's two-phase
admission slots in at synthesis.
