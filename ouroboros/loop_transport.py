"""Transport-outage wait episodes and provider-failure terminal text for the main loop.

A REMOTE pre-dispatch transport failure (typed ``released`` custody: connect
refused/timed out before request bytes left this host, $0 in the ledger) is not a
model failure. Instead of burning the fallback chain or terminalizing, the round
gate in ``loop.py`` latches a :class:`TransportWaitEpisode` and waits: durable
``network_wait`` events + owner progress notes, an interruptible backoff sleep,
then a free redial of the SAME round (the round budget is not consumed). The wait
is bounded only by the task's existing rails — owner deadline, budget, Stop, and
the supervisor's absolute ceiling — never by a new limit. When the rails run out,
``_handle_provider_unavailable`` takes a deterministic no-resend terminal keyed on
the episode's ``wait_cause`` (no forced-final provider call).

Also hosts the owner-facing provider-failure text helpers and terminal salvage
readers used by that terminal path (extracted from ``loop.py``, which is at its
size-ratchet byte cap).
