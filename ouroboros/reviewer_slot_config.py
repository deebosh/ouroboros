"""Reviewer-slot configuration SSOT (phase 6.1).

ONE structured setting — ``OUROBOROS_REVIEWER_SLOTS`` — describes every
configured reviewer row: the commit-triad slots, the scope slots, and the one
optional advisory reviewer. Each row is::

    {"slot_id": "t_9f3a", "route": {"kind": "api_chat" | "agent_session",
                                    "target_id": "<model id | harness[=model]>"},
     "effort": "high"}

or, mutually exclusively, a reference to a configured subagent
(``OUROBOROS_SUBAGENTS`` row)::

    {"slot_id": "t_9f3a", "subagent_id": "<roster id>", "effort": "high"}

``slot_id`` is a STABLE owner-assigned identity, never an array index: a row's
receipts must keep lining up with its own history when the owner reorders or
edits rows (see ``review_substrate.slot_id_for_row`` for why a model is not an
identity either). ``target_id`` is an API model id on the ``api_chat`` kind and
an OPAQUE Claudexor route spec (``harness[=model]`` — Claudexor's own
reviewer-panel spelling, no ``::`` syntax) on ``agent_session``. Effort is a
per-row property on the existing ``EFFORT_SCALE`` — the same mechanism the
model lanes use, deliberately not a new one.

An actor reference never duplicates route/model/effort knobs: the roster row is
their SSOT, resolved ONCE at load/admission into the same frozen slot fields a
direct row carries (route drift after admission changes later waves only). An
``agent_session`` actor delivers through the existing session executor; an
``api_model`` actor delivers as bounded native tool rounds — retrieval, never
the assembled ``api_chat`` packet.

MIGRATION (D15: "старый читается, если новых нет"): when the structured key is
absent, the legacy comma-lists (``OUROBOROS_REVIEW_MODELS`` /
``OUROBOROS_SCOPE_REVIEW_MODELS``) plus the phase-5 per-row route lists are
read into rows, and the global Review / Scope Review efforts are copied into
each row. There is NO permanent double-write: once the structured key is
saved, the comma keys become a derived runtime projection
(``project_reviewer_slots_into_env``) for legacy consumers. Task acceptance
stays API-only by owner decision (D15); commit, scope, plan, advisory, and skill
review follow their configured delivery rows.

Malformed configuration RAISES: mapping a typo to ``api_chat`` would silently
spend the API money the owner configured the row to move off of, and mapping
it to ``agent_session`` would silently delegate a row the owner never
delegated (same posture as ``configured_review_routes``).
