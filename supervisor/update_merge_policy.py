"""Presentation-only labels and text for managed-update conflicts.

Git decides whether a merge is clean. Every conflict, regardless of pathname,
goes through the same reviewed assisted resolver. The doc/code/hot split only
helps the resolver and UI describe the plan; it grants or blocks nothing.
``assisted_objective`` renders the resolver task's objective text — presentation
only as well; the authority lives in the tx marker and its fingerprint.
