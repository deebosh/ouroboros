# Design note — usage-ledger compaction (CPL4-C6, monetary authority)

Owner sanction: batch №8 item 1A (2026-09-01) — "seq-preserving compaction
snapshot (settled rows folded into a stamped baseline row + archive of the raw
segment)", excised from the CPL-4 persistence train into its own reviewed lane
because the ledger is the monetary authority.

## 1. Problem

`state/usage_attempts.jsonl` is the append-only monetary authority
(`ouroboros/usage_ledger.py`). Every reservation re-reads it under the
cross-process monetary lock; a ~20 MB ledger costs ~0.5 s per full re-read
under that lock (the 2026-07-23 lock-timeout incident;
`USAGE_LEDGER_WARN_BYTES` in `ouroboros/context_budget.py` warns at exactly
that point). The in-process warm caches (#129) bound the *steady-state* cost,
but every cold read (process start, refold on any doubt) still replays the
whole file, and the file grows without bound: each physical attempt appends a
2–4 row lifecycle chain that stays forever after it is terminal.

## 2. Sanctioned shape

Fold the terminal history into a **stamped baseline block** at the head of the
ledger and move the raw pre-compaction bytes, verbatim, into an append-only
archive segment. Nothing is deleted: the archive holds every original row
(with its original `seq`); the live file holds an exact, structurally
validated aggregate plus every row that is still live.

## 3. What folds, what never folds

| rows | disposition | why |
|---|---|---|
| `kind="attempt"`, final state `settled` / `unresolved` / `released`, and **no review attribution** (`review_skill`/`review_wave_id`/`review_slot_id` all empty) | folded (their whole seq chain) | terminal, id never re-asserted by any writer (`attempt_id` is a one-shot uuid4 minted at reserve time); aggregation-complete under §5 |
| `kind="attempt"`, final state `reserved` / `dispatched` (in-flight) | **retained verbatim** | INVARIANT: in-flight/unsettled rows are never folded — their terminal transition still has to join them by `attempt_id` in the live replay |
| `usage_baseline` / `usage_baseline_group` from a previous compaction | re-folded (header replaced, groups merged by key, exact-decimal sums added) | baselines must not accumulate per epoch |
| `kind="subscription_session"`, `"external_unmetered"` | **retained** | their `attempt_id` is deterministically re-derived from a stable external id and re-asserted on replay: `_append_single_settled_row` dedups and conflict-checks against the LIVE replay. Folding them would turn an idempotent replay into a silent double charge. Disclosed residual: these rows keep growing (slowly — one row per delegated run / external dispatch); a future lane may fold them behind an archived-identity membership check. |
| `kind="legacy_*"` | **retained** | same idempotency argument: `ensure_legacy_imported` dedups candidate rows against live `attempt_id`s if the completion watermark is ever lost mid-history. Bounded one-time set. |
| attempts with review attribution | **retained** | `skill_review_usage` projects historical waves per-attempt (`attempt_ids`, `attempts` lists) for durable review receipts; folding would erase that projection. Disclosed residual (skill-review waves only; ordinary task/review traffic carries no `review_*` attribution). |
| unknown future kinds | **retained** | fail-safe default: fold only what this design proves aggregation-complete |
| quarantine file | untouched | quarantined bytes are already out of the replay; `integrity_degraded` stays path-derived and unaffected |

## 4. Baseline block shape

The compacted file is `[header row] [group rows …] [retained rows …]`.

**Header** (`kind="usage_baseline"`, exactly one, always seq 1 when present):

```json
{"kind":"usage_baseline","attempt_id":"baseline-<hex12>","state":"settled",
 "seq":1,"ts":"…","baseline_id":"<hex12>","compaction_epoch":N,
 "archive_rel":"archive/usage_ledger/segment_….jsonl",
 "source_sha256":"…","source_size_bytes":B,"source_row_count":R,
 "source_first_seq":1,"source_last_seq":K,
 "folded_row_count":F,"folded_attempt_count":A,
 "group_count":G,"retained_row_count":T}
```

The header is a pure stamp: `_summary`/`_breakdown_bucket` skip it entirely
(it contributes no money, no counts, no tokens). `source_sha256` is the
SHA-256 of the archived segment's exact bytes — together with the segment's
own embedded previous header this forms a tamper-evident hash chain over the
whole history.

**Group rows** (`kind="usage_baseline_group"`): one per attribution tuple

```
key = (state, model, provider, category, source,
       task_id, root_task_id, parent_task_id,
       prompt_cache_ttl, cost_known, cost_final, pricing_known, bound_known)
```

carrying: the key fields verbatim; `folded_attempt_count` (int ≥ 1);
`cost_usd` / `reservation_upper_bound_usd` as **exact-decimal JSON strings**
(§5); token sums (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `cached_tokens`,
`cache_write_tokens`) as ints, absent when no folded row reported the field;
`root_limit_usd` = min over the group's known values (else absent);
`baseline_id` joining the header; empty `review_*` attribution.

Why per-group rows and not the literally single row of the sanction sketch:
budget enforcement is **per-root** (`reserve_attempt` filters finals by
`root_task_id`; `usage_projection` takes `min` of row `root_limit_usd`), and
`usage_breakdown` groups by model/provider/category/task/root. A single global
row would silently zero per-root accounting — a budget bypass. One stamped
baseline *block* whose group rows preserve the full attribution tuple keeps
every existing aggregation exact while remaining one atomic, stamped unit.

## 5. Monetary exactness rule (the fixed rule)

Monetary equality is defined **on decimals, never on float accumulation**:

- The compactor parses the source segment with `parse_float=Decimal` and sums
  each group's `cost_usd` / `reservation_upper_bound_usd` as exact `Decimal`s
  of the literals actually stored in the file.
- Those sums run in an **explicit** decimal context (`_exact_money`:
  `prec = MONEY_PRECISION = 60`, `Inexact` trapped), never the ambient one.
  The interpreter default keeps 28 significant digits, which silently rounds
  a large-magnitude sum — and because the group row and the self-check that
  approves it are computed the same way, a rounded total verifies against
  itself while the float projection stays equal on both sides. Sixty digits
  is far past any real ledger; past even that, the trap turns the loss into
  an abort instead of an approximation. Decimal *construction* is
  context-free by language rule, so stored literals are always captured
  exactly; only arithmetic needs the context.
- Group sums are stored as exact-decimal **JSON strings** (`"cost_usd":
  "12.3456789"`, `format(dec, "f")`, no exponent). `_number()` — the single
  row-level monetary parser used by validation, `_summary`, and every
  projection — already accepts numeric strings, so no reader changes shape.
  A float re-serialization would round the exact sum to the nearest double;
  the string keeps the invariant byte-checkable forever, including across
  re-compactions (group merges sum the decimal strings exactly).
- Retained rows are re-serialized from the standard float parse (shortest-repr
  round-trip). The compactor VERIFIES, per retained row, that the re-parsed
  `Decimal` view of the new line equals the `Decimal` view of the original
  line on every field (only `seq` / `pre_compaction_seq` may differ); every
  literal our writers ever emit is shortest-repr so this holds identically,
  and a foreign non-canonical literal (one that is not double-round-trippable)
  triggers **abort, not approximation**.
- Before committing, the compactor replays the candidate bytes through the
  PRODUCTION aggregation (`_final_rows` → `_summary`, per-root summaries with
  `min` limits, `_breakdown_bucket` global and per model/provider/category/
  task/root axis) and requires the rendered dicts to be **equal** to the same
  render of the source rows. Any inequality — including a sub-microdollar
  float-rounding boundary — aborts the compaction and leaves the ledger
  byte-identical. Compaction is an optimization; correctness never trades.

So: the decimal ledger-level sums are exactly preserved by construction, and
the float projection the budget enforcement actually reads is proven equal by
replay before the swap, else no swap.

## 6. seq policy

The live file keeps the substrate's strongest integrity property: **dense
`seq` from 1** (the validator's density check is what detects mid-file loss
and tampering). A gap-tolerant validator would have weakened that authority,
so instead the compacted file starts a fresh dense epoch:

- baseline header = seq 1, groups 2..G+1, retained rows follow densely in
  their original relative order;
- every retained row keeps its original seq as `pre_compaction_seq`;
- the header records `source_first_seq`/`source_last_seq`, and the archive
  segment holds every original row with its original `seq` untouched.

Monotonicity and density are preserved (the lane invariant); the original seq
values are never lost (archive + `pre_compaction_seq`). Nothing durable
references ledger rows by `seq` (cross-references are `attempt_id`s); resume
fingerprints are invalidated structurally by the inode change (§8).

Validator additions (`_validate_records`): baseline rows are legal only as
the leading block of a full-file validation (a baseline row in an appended
tail, or after any non-baseline row, is corrupt); exactly one header, first;
group rows must carry the header's `baseline_id` and a positive
`folded_attempt_count`; group state ∈ {settled, unresolved, released}; the
existing per-attempt transition and numeric checks apply unchanged (monetary
strings parse through `_number`).

**The stamp's own provenance is validated, not trusted.** The header is the
only ledger row that points at bytes outside its file, so the substrate — the
thing that decides what a well-formed row IS — checks it:

- `compaction_epoch` is a positive int; `source_sha256` is 64 hex;
- `archive_rel` is *bounded* (`usage_ledger.valid_archive_rel`): relative,
  forward-slash, exactly `archive/usage_ledger/<name>`, no `..`, no absolute
  path, no drive letter, no separator inside the name. A tampered header can
  therefore never aim a reader at a file elsewhere on the host;
- the counts must **close**: `folded_row_count + retained_row_count ==
  source_row_count`, `source_first_seq == 1`, `source_last_seq ==
  source_row_count`, and `source_size_bytes ≥ 1`;
- the block must agree with its header: the number of group rows equals
  `group_count` and their `folded_attempt_count`s sum to the header's. Once
  the first non-baseline row closes the block, a later group row — even one
  carrying the real `baseline_id` — is corrupt. That is the money-injection
  shape the position rule exists to refuse;
- `pre_compaction_seq` is checked as the provenance claim it is: legal only
  under a leading header, strictly increasing, only up to the first
  non-baseline row that carries none (post-compaction appends never carry
  it, and a re-compaction rewrites the whole file), and **inside the source
  range the header declares** (`source_first_seq`..`source_last_seq`) — a
  retained row may not claim to come from bytes nobody archived.

## 7. Aggregation contract (`_usage_rows`)

`_summary` and `_physical_call_count`/`_breakdown_bucket` become
baseline-aware in the narrowest way:

- `usage_baseline` header: skipped (no money, no counts);
- `usage_baseline_group`: every **count** increment (`attempt_counts`,
  `unknown_unmetered`, `non_final_rows`, physical calls, `prompt_cache_ttls`)
  uses `weight = folded_attempt_count`; every **sum** adds the row's carried
  aggregate once. For all existing kinds `weight == 1` and the code path is
  byte-equivalent to today's.

The group key (§4) makes each group homogeneous in every branch predicate
`_summary` evaluates per row (`cost is None`, `cost_final`,
`pricing_known is False`, `bound is None`, state), so the per-group branch is
exactly the per-row branch taken `weight` times with the sums pre-added.

## 8. Concurrency, crash-safety, caches

- Compaction runs **only under the same monetary lock** (`_locked(root)`) as
  every read-check-append transaction, invoked from `reserve_attempt`'s
  locked section before its ledger read (§9). No second lock, no new lock
  ordering.
- **The lock has two tiers, chosen by a capability predicate, and the pass
  runs on one of them only.** `platform_layer.kernel_file_locks_enforced`
  decides once per lock directory by kernel-locking a scratch file there:
  only the kernel's own "this filesystem cannot" (ENOLCK/EOPNOTSUPP/ENOSYS)
  selects the **name tier**; every other answer is the **enforced tier**.
  The tier is never chosen by a refusal on a live acquisition.
  *Enforced tier* (POSIX `fcntl.flock`, Windows `LockFileEx` — both held on
  the lock fd): every other hold of this lock is milliseconds; a compaction
  pass over a multi-megabyte ledger can legitimately exceed its 90 s
  staleness window, and a lock evicted purely by age would put a second
  writer on the same authority. So the acquisition takes a **kernel lock on
  the lock fd** in addition to the O_EXCL name, a kernel refusal that is not
  contention (EAGAIN/EACCES/EWOULDBLOCK = held by someone: stand down and
  re-contend) **fails closed** — no descriptor, our own file removed, a
  stale lock never evicted without the held flock, never a silent fall back
  to the name protocol — `_named_lock` acquires **owner-aware** (a live
  owner PID is never evicted on age), and the hold yields a **heartbeat**
  (`platform_layer.refresh_exclusive_file_lock`) the pass beats at every
  checkpoint — inside the long span (both row walks of the candidate build
  and each verification stage), then **immediately before each snapshot
  re-check, including the final one inside the atomic replace** (writing and
  fsyncing the candidate temp can take arbitrarily long, so the proof of
  ownership runs once the temp is durable, right before the rename — ownership
  first, then the snapshot): a re-check answered while the lock already
  belongs to someone else is a meaningless answer, so the loss must abort the
  pass before the answer is even asked. The lock primitives are
  ownership-exact and kernel-guarded: a stale eviction unlinks only while
  HOLDING the flock on the very fd it judged abandoned (path re-checked
  against it), so of two racing reclaimers at most one can evict; a release
  unlinks before its close, under the still-held flock; the heartbeat answers
  OWNERSHIP rather than success, including for a lock file replaced
  atomically (the path never absent). Windows cannot unlink an open file: its
  eviction re-checks the path after closing the probe, and a freshly won
  lock — held open by its owner — is undeletable there, which is what keeps
  that shape exclusive. On this tier we do not claim a pass can never be
  robbed. What we claim is that it cannot finish while robbed: ownership is
  proven at every checkpoint and immediately before every rename attempt,
  and a `False` heartbeat — or one that cannot be answered at all — aborts
  the pass, leaving the ledger byte-identical.
  *Name tier* (a filesystem the kernel says cannot lock — bare NFS and
  friends): the O_EXCL name protocol runs alone with re-check-then-unlink
  eviction. There is no kernel exclusion, so a heartbeat there is an identity
  check, not a proof. The pass therefore **refuses to run at all** on the
  name tier (`usage_compaction.NAME_TIER_REFUSAL`, logged; the ledger stays
  uncompacted and the 20 MB tripwire names the case), while ordinary
  monetary appends continue under the name protocol as a disclosed best
  effort: on that tier the appends are only as exclusive as the name
  protocol, which is exactly why the whole-file rewrite is withheld.
- **The swap re-proves its snapshot — before, at the last instant, and
  after.** Because the swap replaces the WHOLE file, the pass re-reads the
  live ledger under the same held lock before the archive write and again
  before the rename, and the atomic writer evaluates one more re-proof
  **inside the swap** — after the candidate temp bytes are durable,
  immediately before `os.replace`, and again before EVERY retried attempt
  (`utils.replace_atomic` retries a Windows sharing violation with pauses,
  and a proof taken before a refused attempt is stale by the next one), the
  last instant each replace can still be refused, with the ownership
  heartbeat asked FIRST and the snapshot compare only under a proven hold —
  so a hold lost while the temp was written, or between two attempts,
  refuses the replace, and a row that lands after the outer re-check or
  between attempts survives too. The
  cost of any lost race is one skipped pass, never a charge. (Belt to the
  lock's braces: it also covers a lock broken by a hand repair or an older
  build.) The compare→replace window is closed structurally as well: EVERY
  writer of this ledger appends under this same owner-aware lock — kernel-held
  on the enforced tier, the only tier the pass runs on — and there is no
  unlocked fallback: an acquisition that times out, or that the kernel
  refuses, raises `UsageAccountingError` and writes nothing. After the rename the pass
  re-reads what landed and refuses to report a receipt for bytes that are not
  there.
- Commit order: (1) build + fully verify the candidate in memory (§5, §6);
  (2) write the archive segment — exact source bytes — via O_EXCL write and
  `fsync` the file **and every directory in the chain, on every pass**: the
  segment's parent, `archive/`, and the data root, since syncing a directory
  persists only the entries IT holds. Unconditional, not only where this pass
  created a level: an earlier pass may have created one and died before its
  fsync, so on a retry the directories exist while their durability does not.
  The archive path must also BE this data root's own — a symlink at
  `archive/` or `archive/usage_ledger` aborts the pass, because history must
  never be written through a link — and on POSIX that bound is enforced **at
  the write itself**, not only at a preceding check: the chain
  root→`archive/`→`usage_ledger` is opened `O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW`
  handle-to-handle (`dir_fd`), the segment is created `O_NOFOLLOW` relative
  to the held handle, and file plus every directory HANDLE are fsync'd — so
  the chain proven durable is the one the bytes actually landed in, and a
  link planted between check and write is an abort, not a redirect. On POSIX
  a directory-fsync failure **aborts the pass** (an unsynced archive
  directory plus a completed swap is exactly the crash that loses history);
  Windows has no `dir_fd`/`O_DIRECTORY` and no directory handle to fsync, so
  it keeps the path-based chain as a disclosed best effort chosen by the
  platform predicate, never by swallowing `OSError`; (3) atomically replace
  the live ledger (`_write_bytes_atomic_fsync`), which re-proves the snapshot
  one last time before its `os.replace` (the swap bullet above); (4) emit the
  `usage_ledger_compacted` event. A crash before (3) leaves the ledger
  byte-identical (an orphaned archive segment is harmless and disclosed); a
  crash during (3) leaves either the old or the new file — both valid.
- Cache coherence is structural, not cooperative: the swap changes the inode,
  so every resume fingerprint (`_LEDGER_READ_CACHE`, `_ROWS_MEMO`) refuses to
  warm-resume and refolds from the new file. No cache is asked to remember to
  invalidate.

## 9. Trigger policy (config SSOT, no env knob)

- `ouroboros/config.py`: `USAGE_LEDGER_COMPACT_BYTES = 8_000_000` (compact at
  ~0.2 s-per-replay scale, well under the 20 MB measured-degradation WARN) and
  `USAGE_LEDGER_COMPACT_RETRY_GROWTH_BYTES = 1_000_000`. Constants, not env
  handles.
- `reserve_attempt` calls `maybe_compact_usage_ledger_locked(root)` at the top
  of its locked section: an `os.stat` fast-path (~µs) below the threshold;
  above it, one compaction pass on exactly the path whose lock-hold the file
  size degrades. Every failure inside compaction is contained (logged +
  event), never fails the reservation; a structurally corrupt ledger still
  fails in the normal read path with the normal error.
- Thrash guard: a per-process memo of the last attempted (inode, size); after
  an unprofitable pass (nothing foldable / no shrink / verify-abort) the next
  pass runs only once the file grows by `…_RETRY_GROWTH_BYTES` or is replaced.
- `USAGE_LEDGER_WARN_BYTES` (20 MB) stays as the regression tripwire above the
  mechanism, exactly like the rotation-bounded log warns: it now fires only if
  compaction is broken or the unfoldable residue itself reaches 20 MB.

## 10. History readers: CPL-5 reconcile sweep, audits

CPL-5 (`DESIGN_MODEL_VISIBLE_LOGGED.md` §3.3, implementation not yet landed on
this base) reconciles `model_send` seals against "an attempt row in the
usage-accounting replay". After compaction a folded attempt is no longer in
the live replay, so this lane ships the join surface the sweep must use:

- `usage_compaction.archived_attempt_ids(root)` — the `attempt_id` set of
  every archived segment, walked through the tamper-evident header chain
  (live header → segment; segment's own embedded header → older segment, …).
  Each hop is verified, not trusted:
  - the reference is bounded twice — by the substrate's textual rule (§6) and
    by the RESOLVED path having the archive directory as its parent, so a
    symlink planted in the archive cannot import a foreign file's ids;
  - the segment must match the naming header's `source_sha256`,
    `source_size_bytes` and `source_row_count`, and must itself **validate as
    a ledger** (`_validate_records`: dense seq, legal transitions,
    well-formed rows). A tamperer who also repairs the hash still has to
    produce a structurally valid former generation;
  - **the chain's epochs must step down by exactly one and end at epoch 1
    with a header-less segment.** The source of epoch N is exactly the file
    epoch N-1 produced, so this holds by construction — and it is what makes
    re-pointing a live header at an older *genuine* segment (correct hash,
    correct counts) corruption rather than a legitimately shorter history;
  - **the archive anchors the live stamp.** The step-down rule alone only
    proves the chain BELOW the header, and `compaction_epoch` is as mutable as
    the rest of the row, so a forgery that repoints AND lowers the epoch walks
    a valid, short chain. The generations such a forgery orphans are still on
    disk: no segment may carry a generation newer than the live stamp, read
    from each segment's own embedded header rather than from its name. The one
    legal newer case is an uncommitted orphan of the CURRENT generation (a
    lost snapshot race, a crash before the swap), recognised because its
    embedded leading row is the live header itself. The anchor scan runs in
    the directory the chain was walked in — on POSIX through the
    `O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW` dir-fd held for the whole question, so a
    directory swapped after the walk cannot hide a generation from it — and
    an entry the scan cannot list, open or read is `UsageLedgerCorrupt`: the
    scan did not complete, so the question is UNKNOWN. A first row that reads
    but does not parse is a torn segment from a crashed write: no evidence of
    any generation, left to the walk;
  - the archive directory must be **this data root's own**: neither
    `archive/` nor `archive/usage_ledger` may be a symlink, the resolved
    directory must be exactly the resolved root's archive path, and no segment
    may be a link. Otherwise "the segment resolves next to the archive
    directory" is a tautology — both sides resolve through the same link. On
    POSIX the reader enforces this **at the open**: the segment is opened
    `O_NOFOLLOW` through the same `O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW` `dir_fd` handles
    the writer uses — held once for the whole question, chain walk and epoch
    anchor alike — and is fingerprinted and read from that fd — so a link
    planted after any path-based look is an open error, never a read through
    it (a byte-identical copy behind a link hashes perfectly; only refusing
    the traversal itself defends). Windows keeps the path-based checks, best
    effort, by the platform predicate;
  - per-segment results are cached by path, but the hit requires the file's
    fingerprint (inode/device/size/mtime_ns) to match, so a segment deleted
    or rewritten after a warm read surfaces as `UsageLedgerCorrupt` instead
    of keeping an audit's "logged" verdict alive. A fingerprint is not proof
    of identity, though: an in-place same-size rewrite within the filesystem's
    timestamp granularity keeps it. So a hit ALSO requires a file whose mtime
    has settled (> 2 s old) and an entry younger than 60 s — a cached read is
    evidence with a shelf life. **Residual, disclosed:** a rewrite that
    restores `mtime_ns` exactly can still be answered from a warm entry for up
    to that minute. Closing it would mean re-hashing every segment on every
    question, which is the quadratic cost this cache exists to avoid; the
    chain hash still binds every segment the answer depends on, and any
    process that starts, or asks a minute later, re-hashes;
  - the union over a whole chain is cached by the chain's identity
    ((`archive_rel`, sha) per hop), so a bulk reverse sweep of H seals costs
    H cheap stat-checked walks and ONE union, not H unions over the whole
    archived id set.
- `usage_compaction.usage_attempt_recorded(root, attempt_id, live_ids)` —
  membership in live replay ∪ archive.
- A live leading row that cannot be **read at all** (bad UTF-8, bad JSON, not
  an object) raises `UsageLedgerCorrupt` rather than returning "no baseline
  header". `None` from `_live_baseline_header` means exactly one thing — a
  readable first row that is not a stamp, i.e. no compaction has happened —
  because the two states are otherwise indistinguishable to the sweep and the
  wrong one turns a folded attempt into a reported orphan seal.

Contract for the CPL-5 lane (recorded here and in the review packet): the
reverse sweep's "no attempt row" verdict (`orphan_seal`) must consult this
union, not the live replay alone; an unreadable/mismatched segment is the
sweep's existing UNKNOWN → skip-pass case (fail-soft, the API raises typed
`UsageLedgerCorrupt`). The baseline header in the live file is the structural
signal that the live replay is not the full per-attempt history.

`legacy-import` needs no such lookup: its rows are never folded (§3), so its
existing live-replay dedup keeps working under a lost watermark.

## 11. Module placement

New leaf `ouroboros/usage_compaction.py` (domain D16): fold policy +
archive/verify/swap + history readers. It imports FROM `usage_ledger`
(substrate) and `_usage_rows` (aggregation leaf); `usage_accounting` calls
INTO it from `reserve_attempt`. The substrate stays policy-free (it learns
only the new row kinds' validation), the one-way seam
`usage_ledger ← usage_accounting` is unchanged, and the compactor — which must
know the aggregation semantics — lives beside the aggregation, not inside the
byte authority.

## 12. Invariants (pinned by tests/test_usage_compaction.py)

1. **Byte-exact money**: decimal sums of `cost_usd` /
   `reservation_upper_bound_usd` over finals are identical before/after; the
   full `usage_projection` (global + per-root incl. limits) and
   `usage_breakdown` (all axes) renders are equal dicts. A sum needing more
   than the ambient 28 digits (10²⁸ + 1) keeps its last digit — pinned by an
   oracle summing in its own, wider context.
2. **Unsettled never fold**: reserved/dispatched chains survive verbatim
   (modulo seq) and settle correctly after compaction.
3. **Crash-safety**: a failure injected at the ledger rename ITSELF leaves a
   byte-identical, valid, further-usable ledger, with the archive segment
   already on disk holding the exact source bytes; the archive directory
   chain is fsync'd before the swap — including on the RETRY after a pass that
   died on that fsync — and a POSIX directory-fsync failure aborts with the
   ledger untouched.
4. **Budget sees the same numbers**: root/global enforcement thresholds are
   unchanged across compaction.
5. **CPL-5 join survives**: every pre-compaction `attempt_id` remains
   resolvable through live ∪ archive, across chained compactions; a tampered
   segment, a re-hashed but structurally broken segment, a deleted segment
   behind a warm cache, a same-size rewrite once the cache window closes, an
   out-of-archive reference, a symlinked archive directory, an epoch-skipping
   chain, a rollback the archive out-anchors, a directory swapped between the
   chain walk and the anchor scan, an archive entry the anchor cannot open,
   and an unreadable leading row are each typed corruption (UNKNOWN/skip),
   never silent absence; an
   uncommitted orphan segment of the live generation is NOT corruption; the
   chain union is built once per chain.
6. **Idempotency survives**: subscription/external replays after compaction
   dedup (no double charge) and still conflict-check; legacy import stays
   correct with and without its watermark.
7. **Trigger policy**: no compaction below threshold; thrash guard holds;
   verify-abort leaves the ledger untouched; the pass is entered with the
   monetary lock demonstrably HELD.
8. **Structure**: baseline rows only at head — a header is refused for its
   POSITION while the identical block validates at the head, and a group row
   cannot rejoin a closed block; header counts must close and agree with the
   block; `pre_compaction_seq` is unique, increasing, and legal only under a
   stamp; quarantine/`integrity_degraded` semantics unchanged.
9. **No pass loses a concurrent charge**: a row appended between snapshot and
   swap aborts the pass and survives byte-for-byte, with money equal to
   before-plus-that-row — including a row that lands between the pre-swap
   re-check and the rename, refused by the re-proof inside the atomic writer
   at the last instant; the lock's tier is chosen by the capability
   predicate — on the enforced tier it is kernel-held (flock / LockFileEx on
   the lock fd) and a kernel refusal that is not contention fails the
   acquisition closed rather than degrading to the name protocol, on the
   name tier the pass refuses to run while appends continue — owner-aware,
   and heartbeaten through the long span, with ownership proven immediately
   before each snapshot re-check — including inside the atomic writer, once
   the temp is durable and right before EVERY rename attempt, retries
   included, ownership first (a loss as the commit section is entered aborts
   before the pre-archive look and writes no orphan; a loss at the archive
   aborts before the re-check is even asked; a loss while the temp is
   written, or between two rename attempts, refuses the replace — as does a
   charge that lands between them); a pass that loses the hold abandons its
   work instead of swapping; of two reclaimers racing
   over a stale lock at most one can evict (eviction only under the held
   flock on the judged fd); a heartbeat after an atomic replacement of the
   lock file answers False; a writer that cannot take the lock refuses in
   typed form rather than appending without it; and the swap reports a
   receipt only for bytes it re-read at the path.
10. **Provenance is bounded**: `pre_compaction_seq` names a row inside the
    header's declared source range; the archive directory is the data root's
    own, through no symlink — enforced on POSIX at the open/create itself via
    `O_NOFOLLOW` `dir_fd` handles for both writer and reader, so a link
    planted after any check can neither receive nor serve history; the epoch
    anchor is scanned through the very handle the chain was walked in, so a
    directory swapped in between cannot hide a generation; and no archived
    segment carries a generation newer than the live stamp (bar an
    uncommitted orphan of that stamp).

## 13. Explicitly out of scope

- Folding subscription/external/legacy/review-attributed rows (disclosed
  residuals, §3).
- Any GC of archive segments or the quarantine file (append-only, never).
- The CPL-5 sweep implementation itself (not on this base; §10 records its
  contract).
- Changing `USAGE_LEDGER_WARN_BYTES` or the lock timeouts.
