# Ledger corrections discovered during v7next transplants (append-only)

Rows of the reference MIGRATION_v7.md / DOMAIN_MAP.md falsified by upstream drift,
with evidence, found lane by lane. Applied to the campaign's carried ledger at F5.

## From the D15 pilot (base b9f7597f, 2026-08-30)
1. MIGRATION row 351 (`tools/core.py::_filter_out_project_store` ->
   `project_facts.py::filter_out_project_store`, status "pending upstream
   transfer") — SUPERSEDED-BY-UPSTREAM: the tip already carries the extraction
   (project_facts.py byte-identical to the reference; core.py keeps only the
   import alias at :17 with two call sites).
2. DOMAIN_MAP §D15 "v7 delta" prose — remeasure from the new base: consolidator
   delta absorbed upstream (now 0); the true residue is +23/-12 in two files
   (consciousness.py, reflection.py), not +25/-14 in three.
3. RE-PROVE TRAP (D02 family, reflection.py): the reference's
   `_trace_call_errored` reads `_OK_TOOL_STATUSES` (with "untyped") from the v7
   leaf `_outcome_tool_errors`, which upstream does not have; a verbatim replay
   of the delta over upstream's own status handling would invert the fix. The
   D02 adoption must re-derive the delta against upstream bytes.
4. MIGRATION row 166 (retirement of 4 CLAUDE_CODE markers, id "none") — needs an
   explicit ADOPTION disposition (umbrella under D02 or its own row): zero
   production emitters of those markers exist at this tip (claim re-proven).

## From the D16 split pilot (base 5d3398c1, 2026-08-30)
5. MIGRATION row 3911 (`usage_accounting.py::_legacy_snapshot` ->
   `usage_legacy_import.py::_legacy_snapshot`, "verbatim extraction") —
   BYTE-FALSIFIED as a copy source, transform still valid: upstream e9bf6f14
   rewrote the settings-hash comment inside the span (two lines "... prove
   non-mutation by hash, but never copy / their contents into the usage
   archive." became one line "... never copy contents."). The tool's --check of
   the reference leaf against tip bytes fails token-lockstep on exactly this
   span (ast=True, tokens=False); re-emitting from tip bytes is proof-green on
   the first round with the reference declared set {_legacy_snapshot, _locked,
   _read_records_locked} unchanged. Copying the reference leaf verbatim would
   have silently reverted an upstream comment edit.
6. MIGRATION rows 3910-3914 status "pending upstream transfer" — RE-CONFIRMED
   at this tip (contrast with the D15 project_facts case, entry 1 above):
   upstream still carries the unsplit legacy import inside
   ouroboros/usage_accounting.py (1600 lines, exactly at the hard cap;
   IMPORT_REL at :60, the four defs at :1374-:1600). The extraction was
   performed by this lane from tip bytes.

## From the D03 lane (base f61ea3c2, 2026-08-30)
7. MIGRATION rows 3943-3946 (`ouroboros/context.py::{_project_room_fact,
   _runtime_budget_info,_promoted_task_toolset,_delegation_capability_fact}` ->
   `ouroboros/context_runtime_facts.py`, "pending upstream transfer") —
   RE-CONFIRMED pending at this tip (context.py 1590 lines, the four defs at
   :325-:544); the extraction was performed by this lane from tip bytes. The
   reference leaf is BYTE-FALSIFIED as a copy source for ONE of the four
   symbols: upstream b14ba397 ("expose available subagents in runtime
   context") rewrote `_delegation_capability_fact` (docstring collapsed to a
   one-line summary, `configured_route` dropped from the returned fact,
   requested/applied profile evidence and `selected_subagent_id` added, plus
   an all-absent -> None guard). Drift-probe `--check` of the reference leaf
   against tip bytes: 3/4 spans ast=tokens=bytes=True, this span
   ast=False/tokens=False; re-emitting from tip bytes was proof-green on the
   first round. Copying the reference leaf verbatim would have silently
   reverted the upstream subagent-profile feature.
8. MIGRATION row 3960 (`tests/test_context.py::
   test_delegation_fact_carries_configured_route_and_historical_rows` ->
   `tests/test_context_runtime_section.py::<same>`) — SOURCE SYMBOL FALSIFIED
   by the same upstream train: b14ba397 replaced the test with
   `test_delegation_fact_carries_historical_rows_and_profile_evidence`
   (asserts `"configured_route" not in delegation`). The upstream successor
   was moved to the row's destination as an identity continuation (tip
   bytes); the carried ledger must rename the row at F5.
9. MIGRATION row 1641 (`tests/test_context.py::
   test_runtime_section_includes_improvement_backlog_digest` ->
   `tests/test_context_runtime_section.py::<same>`) — SOURCE SYMBOL FALSIFIED:
   upstream 1b7f9497 replaced the test with
   `test_improvement_backlog_digest_is_actor_scoped` (the digest is now
   asserted ABSENT for ordinary/main/project/subagent tasks and present only
   for evolution/deep_self_review). Moved to the row's destination as an
   identity continuation (tip bytes); rename at F5.
10. S7a rows 1614-1640/1642-1648 — RE-CONFIRMED against tip bytes: every other
   moved symbol of the tests/test_context.py split is byte-identical between
   the tip monolith and the reference siblings (the D15-carried
   tests/test_context_memory.py re-derived from tip bytes came out identical
   — the carry was NOT stale), except row 1623's span
   (`test_force_plan_metadata_adds_structured_notice_without_rewriting_user_text`),
   which upstream drifted ADDITIVELY (rc-phaseC execution-shape assertions) —
   tip bytes transplanted. Note: between the D15 pilot and this lane the 15
   memory tests existed in BOTH tests/test_context.py and
   tests/test_context_memory.py on the integration branch (ran twice); this
   lane completed the split and deduplicated.
11. NO-ROW upstream additions (candidate rows for the carried ledger): 3459dd12
   added 8 recent-chat/archive-generation tests to tests/test_context.py
   (filters_archives_before_recent_bound, retention_proof_cross_thread,
   reads_only_bounded_generation_suffix, materializes_a_bounded_row_suffix,
   malformed_gap_even_when_search_matches_nothing,
   resumes_unconsolidated_archived_generation,
   archive_only_chat_chain_is_complete, missing_cursor_generation_hot_path).
   They have no MIGRATION rows, so this lane left them in the remainder
   tests/test_context.py (612 lines) rather than deciding their theme-home
   unilaterally; by the memory-file theme they are candidates for
   tests/test_context_memory.py at F5.
