"""Continue of a task the owner turned into a Project stays in that room (Batch4 1A).

"Turn into project" writes only the immutable task<->Project binding; the
interrupted worker's own terminal result keeps the chat and project copy it
started with (``agent_task_pipeline`` publishes its local task). Driven through
the real conversion and Continue endpoints on an installed queue: a fresh
Continue admits its new root into the room the binding names (claim, queue row,
successor binding, live and late event addressing), keeping the predecessor's
original folder, exact owner words and money group; a claim frozen before a
later conversion keeps its destination; unreadable or closed room authority
refuses instead of falling back to Main.
